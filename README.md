# Moodie

Our website “Moodie”, mainly serving as health tech, is designated for the ones who suffer from mental disorders with the concentration of Major Depression Disorder and Anxiety Disorder. The word “Moodie”, a type of mood that makes you feel good and comfortable, creates the pathos that we want our users to feel relaxed and comfortable when interacting with our website. Mental disorder has been a crucial and urgent concern in this modern society with the high level of stress and the severe impact from COVID-19, but not everyone who suffers from the mental illness is able to get access to the medical resources either because of their time, their energy or their financial condition.

## Primary Feature

Our main feature is to make the resources and treatments available to everyone who needs assistance related to mental issues. The primary feature is the schedule that the users can fill out themselves, or with the help of therapists, in order to plan their lives ahead of time, and following a stable daily routine can help the patients to stabilize their mood as well. In the schedule, we suggest the users setting up a small goal every day to gain the satisfaction that they lack in their daily life.

## Secondary Features

1. In the treatment section, we provide two main methods for anxiety and depression --ABC worksheet, and interpersonal effectiveness worksheet, which both dedicate to the user’s problem-solving skills and help create a new pathway that will eventually substitute the suicidal thoughts. Besides, some customized treatments or worksheets will be provided based on every user’s special need.
2. The resources section works collaboratively with the treatment, and it points out the myth and the wrong “common sense” that people have towards their own mental condition. By comprehending their thoughts and mental behaviors, they will further approach their inner world by receiving more scientific side of the mental illness. 
3. Another feature is to help the patients who are currently on medication to stay on their medication and take the pills on time everyday, and we provide them with the crisis help that includes some activities to calm them down (including TIPs, pace breathing and intense exercise...) and some people or place that they can call for urgent help.

## Final thoughts and future developments
Compared to other websites designed for mental disorders, we focus more on the treatment and therapy instead of counseling; we believe that the scientific method is always a vital component in order to support the group who needs mental care.

Due to the limited time schedule, we are unable to integrate a user file system into the website. The current version only supports personalization for a single user, and in the future if we will continue to develop a stable user storage system to make the website accessilbe for every user.
